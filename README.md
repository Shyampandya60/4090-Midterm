1) Train a binary classifier (called A) on the dataset using transfer learning
2) Next, train the SRGAN to generate 128x128 images. Each image of the training is downscaled to 32x32.
3) Show some examples of scaled images in JNB
4) Utilize the images generated by SRGAN in order to train a new model (called B)
5) Train the SRGAN for at least 150 epochs
6) Divide the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing
7) Apply normalization and image transformation, and demonstrate some of the transformed samples
8) Compare the performance of both models using different metrics such as F1, Accuracy, AUC
9) Since there is limited time to use Google Colab GPU every 12 hours, save your models after each n epoch
